# Dynamite Plunger

Delete your code and make sure it never comes back! J/k - this is an Arduino
sketch that sends the "enter" keystroke to your computer when a button is
pressed on the Arduino. (But you can put that Arduino inside a box that looks
like a dynamite plunger!)

## Local Development
1. Install system prerequisites
   * **PlatformIO Core -** This project uses [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/)
     to build and install our code on the Arduino. If you're on a Mac with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), just tap out:
     ```shell
     brew install platformio
     ```
     [Alternative installation methods can be found here](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html#installation-methods).
